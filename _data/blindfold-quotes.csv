"Young, Lester","[...] when I first came to New York, I got boos because I didn't play like Coleman Hawkins. I used to do a lot of teardrops behind that. But I say some people just don't have eyes for certain things. Just listen, the way you feel. When I hear those people play like that, I'll go and buy their records too and things, and sit up and listen.",blindfold024,0:05:38
"Zetterlund, Monica","[On Lena Horne] Oh, she's very good. I prefer when I can watch her at the same time. I don't want to listen to her when I can't see her because I think she is one of the greatest artists on the stage.",blindfold009,0:13:05
"Peterson, Oscar","One thing that I always do, in buying my own personal records, is even if there's a record with just four bars that I like, I'll buy it!",blindfold023,0:03:52
"Peterson, Oscar","I think, regardless of what type of music there is, or what type of music you listen to, there is such a thing as good and bad, and I would classify that as good Dixieland, although I don't particularly go for Dixieland.",blindfold023,0:04:29
"Peterson, Oscar","What do I want to say? The clean technique, the taste, the touch, there isn't anything you can say wrong about the piano, the piano chorus, because Teddy [Wilson] is, more or less to me, a genius.",blindfold023,0:05:47
"Desmond, Paul",Playing accordion is sort of a self inflicted occupational hazard that requires an awful lot in the way of content to justify it.,blindfold005,0:06:35
"Gordon, Dexter","It's a different groove and it's possible to get a nice groove going with an organ. I wouldn't necessarily choose an organ for my group or something, but I can... The public digs it, obviously because back East they are very popular, especially around Chicago and some of the places in New York uptown. I guess because it trails up the room and it sounds like a big band and that's because there's nothing different with an organ trio and a piano trio.",blindfold007,0:05:49
"Gordon, Dexter","Joe Henderson he sounds good. New saxophonist on the scene. Yeah, it sounds good. I like his... It's nice and fluid and then he gets a nice full sound on the bottom of his horn.",blindfold007,0:15:01
"Gordon, Dexter","It was in the summer and it was hot and the joint was just packed, you couldn't move in there. After the first set, Don took off his shirt and his undershirt. He was just playing in his pants, playing nude tenor. Yeah. He's fantastic. Yeah. We had a ball at night.",blindfold007,0:16:24
"Gaurdali, Vince","Yet, in jazz, I feel this, there's a certain amount of honesty in everybody's endeavors, whether they come off or not.",blindfold019,0:03:50
"Gaurdali, Vince",Corcovado is kind of close to me. It's one of the first songs I heard Joao Gilberto doing on his capitol record and it really gassed me the first time I heard it.,blindfold019,0:04:43
"Gaurdali, Vince","The organ doesn't make it. After hearing what they do in Brazil with the organ and then hearing this, it doesn't make it. I was fortunate to hear some records from there. Just because you play the claves don't mean that is bossa nova.",blindfold019,0:06:50
"Gaurdali, Vince","[...] if you're going to bring an instrument into jazz that's not been into jazz before, I think it's best to get a solid toe hold with the foundation, bring it from where it's from and play it that way, then go from there.",blindfold019,0:08:17
