"[Plays ""Struttin' with Some Barbecue"" by Jean Thielemans, from Man Bites Harmonica!, Riverside Records (1958). Personnel: Pepper Adams, baritone saxophone; Kenny Drew, piano; Wilbur Ware, bass; Art Taylor, drums.]",,
Ronnie Ross,The whole record though it has a nice feel about it. I'd give that three stars.,0:02
Leonard Feather,Why do you think the harmonica was justifiable here?,0:09
Ronnie Ross,Well he played with a lot of jazz feeling and... very good. Sort of composed a lot but generally I don't like that kind of thing.,0:14
Leonard Feather,How'd you like the rhythm section of it?,0:25
Ronnie Ross,I liked it.,0:26
Leonard Feather,Okay.,0:30
"[Plays ""A Foggy Day"" by Lars Gullin, from Baritone Sax, Atlantic Records (1956). Personnel: Lars Gullin, baritone saxophone; Ake Persson, trombone; Jan Allan, trumpet; Rune Ofwerman, piano; George Riedel, bass; Bert Dahlander, drums; Goesta Theselius, arranger.]",,
Ronnie Ross,"Uh, that was Lars Gullin on baritone. I think he's one of the most original baritone players to come out for a long time. I don't know who the trombone player was. I liked his sound. I think it might've been Ake Persson. But I didn't like the rhythm section very much. It didn't seem to give the backing it should do. It didn't seem to swing very much. The trumpet was good, I liked that but I didn't like the arrangement, it was a bit stereotyped. I suppose it must be a Swedish band that recorded it. I think I'd give that three stars.",0:36
Leonard Feather,Okay. Did you say what you thought of the baritone?,1:22
Ronnie Ross,I think he's very good.,1:24
Leonard Feather,Okay.,1:25
"[Plays ""Feather Bed"" by the Ronnie Ball Quintet, from All About Ronnie, Savoy Records (1956). Personnel: Ronnie Ball, piano; Ted Brown, tenor saxophone; Willie Dennis, trombone; Kenny Clarke, drums.]",,
Ronnie Ross,"I didn't like that very much at all. It sounds like the Lennie Tristano school. I think the tenor player might've been Warne Marsh. I don't know who the trombone player is. Seems sort of music-by-numbers to me. I only give it a couple of stars for the drummer, I thought he was good.",1:29
Leonard Feather,For the drummer?,1:52
Ronnie Ross,Mm-hmm.,1:53
Leonard Feather,How about the piano?,1:54
Ronnie Ross,I didn't like that very much.,1:55
Leonard Feather,Okay. Did you say it was a Tristano-style piano or-,1:56
Ronnie Ross,I don't know it didn't sound very comfortable. The whole thing sounded a bit...made me feel uneasy listening to it.,2:07
Leonard Feather,Okay.,2:17
"[Plays ""Wilbert's Tune"" by Vic Feldman, from On Vibes, Mode Records (1957). Personnel: Vic Feldman, vibes; Frank Rosolino, trombone; Harold Land, tenor saxophone; Carl Perkins, piano; Leroy Vinnegar, bass; Stan Levey, drums.]",,
Ronnie Ross,Better I enjoyed that very much.,2:21
Leonard Feather,Good.,2:22
Ronnie Ross,"I don't know who anybody is on that. I like all the solos the vibraphone, tenor, and trombone. I think the rhythm section is excellent swingin...I'd give that four stars, nearly five, just four though.",2:23
Leonard Feather,That's more your kind of music,2:47
Ronnie Ross,Yeah,2:48
Leonard Feather,Me too. Did you like it much?,2:54
"[Plays ""Just a Sittin' and a Rockin'"" by the Johnny Dankworth Orchestra, from 5 Steps to Dankworth, Verve Records (1957). Personnel: Johnny Dankworth, alto saxophone; Dickie Hawdon, trumpet; Danny Moss, tenor saxophone; Dave Lee, piano; Kenny Clarke, drums; Eric Dawson, bass.]",,
Ronnie Ross,Well I've played that arrangement in England with Johnny Dankworth so...,2:58
Leonard Feather,Oh I didn't know that.,3:06
Ronnie Ross,"I think Johnny's got the only big band in England that's still playing jazz all the way no commercials. Policy at all. I like the tenor solo I think that's Danny moss and the trumpet is Dickie Hawdon, drum player's very good. I think rhythm section could have been a lot better though...It sounded a bit lifeless in parts no offense John. I'd give that three stars I think.",3:06
Leonard Feather,Okay.,3:54
"[Plays ""Anything Goes"" by Stan Getz and Gerry Mulligan, from Getz Meets Mulligan in Hi-Fi, Verve Records (1957). Personnel: Stan Getz, tenor saxophone; Gerry Mulligan, baritone saxophone; Lou Levy, piano; Ray Brown, bass; Stan Levey, drums.]",,
Ronnie Ross,"I like the spirit of that very much it was a nice swinging thing, but I think it got a bit out of hand at the end it was getting a bit coarse. I don't know who the baritone player or the tenor player were at all. I like the tenor player very much and I liked some of the baritone. I liked the rhythm section definitely strong. I think I'd give that four stars.",3:55
Leonard Feather,Okay.,4:22
"[Plays ""Suspensions"" by Gunther Schuller and George Russel, from Modern Jazz Concert, Columbia Records (1958). Personnel: Jimmy Guiffre, composer.]",,
Ronnie Ross,"Sounds a bit like Jimmy Guiffre's writing to me. I don't think I like It very much. It doesn't seem to have a lot of jazz content in it. I don't think that kind of thing's for me. I'll give that two stars, but it was played very well.",4:31
Leonard Feather,"All right. Well I'll be doing the same thing with you that I did with Albert, see if I can get any further comments on what you heard while we're here.",4:53
Ronnie Ross,Mm-hmm.,5:01
Leonard Feather,Or what you would have liked to hear that you didn't hear anything.,5:01
Ronnie Ross,One of the highlights for me was hearing Duke's band.,5:08
Leonard Feather,Yeah.,5:10
Ronnie Ross,"I believe it wasn't his best performance, but when you heard about somebody over there and you see them for the first time in the flesh, It's a bit paralyzing.",5:14
Leonard Feather,Yeah.,5:25
Ronnie Ross,Especially Duke.,5:26
Leonard Feather,What else?,5:29
Ronnie Ross,I liked the Max Roach group very much...The other night we went to hear Carmen McRae and she knocked me out. I thought that was about the best singer I've heard over here.,5:33
Leonard Feather,Any other bands?,5:48
Ronnie Ross,"I'd like to hear Sonny Rollins, but I think we'll hear him on Thursday.",5:54
Leonard Feather,Oh you didn't get a chance to-,5:59
Ronnie Ross,"No, no.",6:00
Leonard Feather,Is Sonny becoming popular in England? Is he acknowledged?,6:03
Ronnie Ross,Oh yes he's very popular.,6:06
Leonard Feather,"Thank you for joining me. Well let me see. What would you have given five stars if I'd played their music, any five stars ratings?",6:07
Ronnie Ross,"Such sweet thunder by Duke Ellington, the drummers a woman.",6:21
Leonard Feather,That'll do. We'll leave it right there.,6:24
