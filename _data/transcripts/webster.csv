Unknown Speaker,And then talk.,0:13
Ben Webster,That's it.,0:13
Unknown Speaker,That's it.,0:13
Ben Webster,It's the only thing that comes out of my tape. That talk.,0:16
Leonard Feather,"It's all on the tape, yeah.",0:20
Ben Webster,"No, on my tape, I was talking about.",0:22
Leonard Feather,What did you think of that?,0:27
Ben Webster,What'd you say?,0:27
Leonard Feather,Huh?,0:27
Ben Webster,"It's a machine, if it's working.",0:31
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, well it's working. I just want your opinion of the record.",0:34
Ben Webster,"Oh, very good. Very good.",0:37
Leonard Feather,You liked it?,0:39
Ben Webster,Yeah.,0:39
Leonard Feather,"You recognize everybody on it, right?",0:41
Ben Webster,"No, no. Or did I?",0:43
Leonard Feather,"Well, maybe you did, maybe you didn't. You thought it was...",0:45
Ben Webster,"What did... Well that just sounded like Harold Land. And sounded like Coucne on bass. I couldn't... Well I mean when you think of Land, and Counce, you automatically think of Carl Perkins, but it didn't sound like Carl playing piano. On drums, I know Butler. Was it Frank Butler?",0:47
Leonard Feather,Uh-huh.,1:18
Ben Webster,I'm not sure about that.,1:20
Leonard Feather,Do you know all those guys?,1:22
Ben Webster,"But it was very good. I mean it was a very good record. The balance, and the solos, and everything. It was like crazy.",1:23
Leonard Feather,"You like the sound, the stereo sound?",1:33
Ben Webster,"Yeah, that's the in, brings it right to you.",1:35
Leonard Feather,"Yeah. Okay, well, so you know the rating system? What would you give that?",1:40
Ben Webster,Well I don't hear any poor records. I don't think you have any poor records around.,1:50
Leonard Feather,"No, that's right. So what would you give this?",1:50
Ben Webster,Well I like that very much. 12 stars you know.,1:57
Leonard Feather,How about four out of five?,2:03
Ben Webster,"Well, yeah.",2:05
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, four means very good.",2:08
Ben Webster,"I mean, for what they were doing, and what they had to do with, I'd give that the most.",2:08
Leonard Feather,Do you know the tune?,2:14
Ben Webster,"No, I didn't. Well you started rather abruptly. So I didn't get that...",2:20
Leonard Feather,"Well, it doesn't matter.",2:27
Ben Webster,"They do play it in F though, weren't they?",2:29
Leonard Feather,Playing in what?,2:30
Ben Webster,In F?,2:30
Leonard Feather,"You know, I think it's in F, but uh-",2:30
Ben Webster,"Sounded like F to me, I think.",2:36
Leonard Feather,(Plays melody on piano) Yeah. That's right.,2:40
Ben Webster,Well I don't know the chart.,2:46
Leonard Feather,"You want to give it the maximum, five? Or just four?",2:48
Ben Webster,"Well, I don't think you can sound much better. Everybody is so remarkable on the thing.",2:49
Leonard Feather,Okay.,2:56
"[Plays ""When Your Lover Has Gone"" by Cootie Williams and Rex Stewart, from The Big Challenge, Jazztone Records (1957). Personnel: Coleman Hawkins, tenor saxophone; Bud Freeman, tenor saxophone; Cootie Williams, trumpet; Rex Stewart, cornet.]",,
Leonard Feather,"It might be, or maybe the phonograph sharpened it a little, I don't know.",2:59
Is that on?,,
Ben Webster,Heard a beep.,3:19
Unknown Speaker,Do you have what I have or do I have what you have?,3:19
Leonard Feather,Jean?,3:23
Jean,Yeah?,3:26
[Skips],,
Ben Webster,"Play that again, Leonard?",3:26
Leonard Feather,Oh all right.,3:27
Ben Webster,Or you lend me your number?,3:28
[skips],,
Ben Webster,Nobody plays that. He's got this scene going.,3:31
Leonard Feather,Wow.,3:38
Ben Webster,Sounds like C there.,3:42
Leonard Feather,"Yeah that one's C. Yeah, I think that tune is in C.",3:45
Ben Webster,"But when Bean started blowing it sounded like he was in E natural. But he was in E flat, I guess. Play Bean's, brother Bean's.",3:51
Leonard Feather,Here we go.,3:55
Ben Webster,"When Your Lover Is Gone, right?",4:13
Leonard Feather,"Yeah right, that's right. Well, how about it?",4:15
Ben Webster,"Oh, anything Bean's on, and Bud too. That's got to be five. You got those.",4:25
Leonard Feather,Yeah. And you said you could recognize Rex? Right?,4:30
Ben Webster,"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Hes too.",4:30
Leonard Feather,Okay. So you like the whole thing?,4:31
Ben Webster,"Sure. Definitely, yeah. A lot of class in that.",4:44
"[Plays ""You're My Thrill"" by Georgie Auld, from Sax Gone Latin, Capitol Records (1958). Personnel: The Jud Conlon Rhythmaires, vocals.]",,
Ben Webster,This record here?,4:57
Leonard Feather,You couldn't recognize the piano player because there's a thousand players.,4:58
Ben Webster,"No, well I mean...",5:00
Leonard Feather,Well I agree with you.,5:01
Ben Webster,"That's a rather tough record to judge, there. I mean, that style, I would be really afraid to even say... I wouldn't know.",5:07
Leonard Feather,It isn't important who it is-,5:21
Ben Webster,"It sounds like, well I meet a lot of guys who play that style.",5:22
Leonard Feather,Yeah. That's right.,5:28
Ben Webster,"You know, like... do you know, vibrato style?",5:36
Leonard Feather,Yeah.,5:36
Ben Webster,"And see I was rather reluctant about this, altogether, you know?",5:40
Leonard Feather,"Well that doesn't matter, I'm not-",5:44
Ben Webster,But I mean it wasn't enough to judge.,5:46
Leonard Feather,"Well I'm not trying to get you to guess who it was, I just want to know how you feel about the thing-",5:51
Ben Webster,"Well I'm trying to figure out who it was, because I really try to go hear everybody play it, you know.",5:52
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, but regardless of who it was, did you like the arrangement or the style, the way it was played?",5:58
Ben Webster,"Oh yeah, oh yeah. Wonderful.",6:00
Leonard Feather,"You like the Latin rhythm on that too, you think it's-",6:03
Ben Webster,"Wonderful, yeah, yeah. Voices and, what's that, the conga? The drum? Yeah? Very, very nice. Yeah.",6:05
Leonard Feather,"Oh. All right. Well you wouldn't rate it as high as the record before this, would you?",6:20
Ben Webster,"Well I mean the tenor player sounded as though he was playing with the diction, you know? Like he didn't really get a chance to maybe extend himself, because they were cuffed to that particular rhythm.",6:27
Leonard Feather,"Yeah that's right. But you think within those limitations, at least...",6:47
Ben Webster,"Very nice, but... Yeah, very nice I would say. Very nice. Yeah. For that particular type of record.",6:51
Leonard Feather,"Four stars, maybe?",6:59
Ben Webster,"Sure, yeah.",7:01
Leonard Feather,"I forgot to ask what you give the other one, with Coleman Hawkins and Bud.",7:10
Ben Webster,"Anything Bean's on is five stars, I say.",7:10
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, you did tell me five, that's true.",7:10
"[Plays ""All Too Soon"" by Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington, from Ella Fitzgerald Sings The Duke Ellington Song Book Vol. 2, Verve Records (1957). Personnel: Paul Gonsalves, tenor saxophone.]",,
Leonard Feather,"Okay, we're on.",7:16
Ben Webster,Huh?,7:20
Leonard Feather,"We're on. I mean, comments?",7:20
Ben Webster,"Well that's the greatest of all time and time to come. Ella. And Ray Nance, they waste no notes. You give that 50 stars, if you wanted. Yeah.",7:23
Leonard Feather,"All right, any comment on the tenor?",7:42
Ben Webster,"Oh yeah, Paul? My man.",7:44
Leonard Feather,"That's your solo with your background, it's very similar. Does it remind you of you?",7:47
Ben Webster,"Well Paul has his own style, I mean...",7:54
Leonard Feather,Well it's your style.,7:56
Ben Webster,"No, no I wouldn't say that. No. No, no, because I really, frankly, I wish I could get over my horn like Paul, you know?",7:59
Leonard Feather,I think he sounds very much like you on this solo.,8:11
Ben Webster,"He's got his own scene going. Yeah. He's, Paul's something else, man.",8:17
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, that's a nice record.",8:23
Ben Webster,"Yeah. That's boss, yeah.",8:25
Leonard Feather,"That's a very similar arrangement to the original, isn't it?",8:31
Ben Webster,"Well no, on the original I think Lawrence played the first chorus and if I'm not mistaken I think he played that in C, and then we went to D flat.",8:37
Leonard Feather,"Oh maybe so, yeah.",8:52
Ben Webster,"Yeah. If I'm not mistaken, I think-",8:53
Leonard Feather,"The mood on the second chorus is just the same, like Ruth in the background.",8:55
Ben Webster,"Oh yes, well except from the original, I would say, yeah.",8:58
Leonard Feather,How do you think this rates among Duke's tunes?,9:04
Ben Webster,"Oh that's 50 stars. And Miss Fitzgerald, yeah.",9:07
Leonard Feather,Okay. Going on.,9:22
"[Plays ""Dinah"" by Bud Shank and Bob Cooper, from The Swing's To TV, World Pacific Records (1958). Personnel: Bud Shank, woodwinds; Bob Cooper, woodwinds.]",,
Ben Webster,What would you like to know about this?,9:22
Leonard Feather,Any comment?,9:24
Ben Webster,"Well, the tenor was rather faded out. So I couldn't-",9:26
Leonard Feather,There was too much going on?,9:36
Ben Webster,"No, and the voices were very good. But I mean the tenor was rather subdued, and I really couldn't distinguish, if I could, who it was. But very nice arrangement, and the voices were wonderful... Just I guess the tenor player, rather restricted. You know, sticking to the lead. Very nice though. I mean for that particular type thing. I would say very nice.",9:38
Leonard Feather,"You don't have to be polite, you know.",10:21
Ben Webster,Well I've never heard any bad music.,10:25
Leonard Feather,Well okay. I refuse to accept that.,10:29
Ben Webster,"Well no, I'll tell you the reason I that. If you keep listening, let's see if you're still fooling around with the instrument. Your instrument or, rather, you may pick up something that you can use.",10:34
Leonard Feather,Yeah.,10:49
Ben Webster,There you go. That's what I think.,10:49
Leonard Feather,Well how would you rate this? Three is good and four is very good.,10:53
Ben Webster,"Well, nice is nice.",10:55
Leonard Feather,"Three though, yeah?",11:00
Ben Webster,Yeah.,11:02
Leonard Feather,Okay.,11:02
"[Plays ""Body and Soul"" by Chu Berry, from Prez and Chu (Tops on Tenor), Jazztone Records (1955, recorded 1938). Personnel: Roy Eldridge, trumpet; Chu Berry, tenor.]",,
Leonard Feather,What do you think of it?,11:09
Ben Webster,Well it's wonderful. It's Chu and Roy.,11:10
Leonard Feather,"How do you think the background sounded, the rhythm section?",11:18
Ben Webster,Well I mean when I listen to Roy and Chu I don't listen to the rhythm.,11:23
Leonard Feather,Yeah.,11:27
Ben Webster,"And frankly... incidentally, rather, Roy and Chu could accomplish one thing that I could never accomplish. That piano player can play the wrong changes, the bass player play's the wrong changes, and they get their scene going right through that. Break right through. I could never do that. If I don't hear the right bass note, I'm dead. You dig?",11:27
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, I know what you mean.",11:58
Ben Webster,"But they can break through that. Roy and Chu, that's very... What would you call that? Not spectacular, but...",12:01
Leonard Feather,They have strength.,12:09
Ben Webster,"Yeah, no, well I don't know what this is. I mean because it's just like buying a hi-fi speaker. You listen for one thing and I listen for another thing when you buy a speaker, right?",12:13
Leonard Feather,Yeah.,12:26
Ben Webster,"So I mean, I just don't understand that. Because a bad bass note, I'm through man. But they can break through. I don't get off the ground, and they're gone. Bass player play wrong, just keeping rhythm. I would rather say that it is like, bass player's playing the bass drum, you know? Yeah. But I mean if you listen, I'm listening for something else.",12:28
Leonard Feather,"You were saying something about the tune while it was on, about this tune-",13:04
Ben Webster,"Oh, about Body and Soul?",13:04
Leonard Feather,Yeah.,13:04
Ben Webster,Not enough to play on that. Bean's taking that out.,13:09
Leonard Feather,Well nevertheless-,13:12
Ben Webster,When he came back-,13:13
Leonard Feather,Well how do you know this wasn't made later than the tunes?,13:15
Ben Webster,"Well I don't know when this was made, I'll say, but I detest even a request for the tune. Because there's nothing left to play on Body and Soul. Hawk did that. He played Body and Soul. Period.",13:18
Leonard Feather,"But nevertheless, you like this version.",13:30
Ben Webster,"Oh sure, sure.",13:31
Leonard Feather,So how are you going to rate it?,13:31
Ben Webster,50 stars.,13:36
Leonard Feather,Okay.,13:38
[Plays unknown song],,
Ben Webster,"What was it, down in E flat?",13:45
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, I think-",13:49
Ben Webster,"It was nice too. Very nice. Yeah, I wish I could figure out who that was. I was trying to lay it on Stan but I mean Stan's a little heavier than that I think, you know? Wait a minute... no, I don't think that was Stan. He was very good though, he was wonderful. I mean that's that other style. What style do they call this?",13:50
Leonard Feather,What would you call it? I don't know.,14:20
Ben Webster,"I don't know. Cool? I know it's cool, people sneak in with the West Coast, and Chicago style, and you know. Music is music. Swinging. Yeah, I thought it was very nice. Very nice change of pace, yeah. That's what I'd say.",14:24
Leonard Feather,You like the rhythm section?,14:45
Ben Webster,"Oh, wonderful. Everything, everybody. Because I mean this is rather quick, I mean I hear horn. You notice the rhythm section, I would say, when they get in the way. So if the rhythm section's not getting in the way, I don't notice it. You get your swing-",14:48
Leonard Feather,That's all you can hear.,15:10
Ben Webster,... it fit or it don't fit. Yeah.,15:11
Leonard Feather,"Yeah, sure.",15:13
Ben Webster,I mean it goes on no criterion.,15:15
Leonard Feather,Well how would you rate it?,15:20
Ben Webster,Well I like that.,15:21
Leonard Feather,What would that be?,15:21
Ben Webster,Well I wouldn't give it 50.,15:21
Leonard Feather,"Yeah I know, I know that.",15:21
Ben Webster,About 40.,15:28
Leonard Feather,"Well let's say four, yeah?",15:33
Ben Webster,Yeah.,15:34
"[Plays ""Every Time We Say Goodbye"" by Sonny Rollins, from The Sound of Sonny, Riverside Records (1957). Personnel: Sonny Clark, piano.]",,
Leonard Feather,He called me up before and I said I'd call him back.,15:34
Ben Webster,"I ain't in no hurry Leonard, if you want to take care of something.",15:41
Leonard Feather,Well let's just finish this one.,15:44
Ben Webster,Okay.,15:45
Leonard Feather,Because I know you know who it is.,15:45
Ben Webster,"Well, no, I don't know. And I didn't ask because I know the answer's ""no,"" but I think that's Sonny Rollins.",15:47
Leonard Feather,Uh-huh. Well what is it about him that's distinctive if you think of it?,16:05
Ben Webster,"Well I always did dig Sonny because, well I mean I'm getting into...because I like all the kids. But I mean with Sonny's coming on in the mid-40's, most of the kids had a small sound and Sonny always just tried to have a bigger sound. Now I can't say that that's him, I haven't heard him play... I don't have too many records, I'm embarrassed that I don't. I'm trying to pick up on that now.",16:06
Leonard Feather,"Well nevermind, as long as you...",16:49
Ben Webster,"But I don't know, I thought it was Sonny. And as I said, whether it was Sonny or not, I've always admired Sonny because that's the way I think. I think the horn's a big horn and you should get a big sound. You shouldn't choke it, yeah? And he always just tried to get that big sound. My man.",16:51
Leonard Feather,"Well you like the sound of whoever this is, anyway.",17:27
Ben Webster,Yeah. Whoever it is. Whether it's Sonny or not.,17:30
Leonard Feather,You know the tune?,17:33
Ben Webster,Huh?,17:33
Leonard Feather,You know this tune?,17:34
Ben Webster,"I don't know the name of the tune or words. I know the tune enough to get through it, but I...",17:41
Leonard Feather,"Well that doesn't matter, I mean you recognize it. Did you notice the piano player?",17:48
Ben Webster,"No, you want to play it again?",17:50
Leonard Feather,"Well, if you like. You didn't notice him enough to comment, huh?",17:51
Ben Webster,What'd you say?,17:59
Leonard Feather,I mean just notice enough to make any comment on him?,18:00
Ben Webster,"No, I was listening to the tenor player.",18:01
Leonard Feather,"Well I'll play the piano chorus, if you like.",18:01
Leonard Feather,"You couldn't tell who it was, then, just whether you like the style.",18:01
Ben Webster,"No, I like it. Sure, I like that. Sure. But I couldn't tell anyway.",18:01
Leonard Feather,Well how would you rate this?,18:01
Ben Webster,Very good.,18:01
Leonard Feather,"Four, huh?",18:01
Ben Webster,"Sure. Yeah, yeah.",18:10
Leonard Feather,"Well, let me see. Now that's all... I think we have time for one more record. Here we go.",18:28
[Plays unknown song],,
Ben Webster,Well I don't know.,18:36
Leonard Feather,"Well regardless of who it is, does it swing? Do you like it?",18:42
Ben Webster,"Yeah, love that. I mean if you could put an underdog on that, you see because this guy... I think that's Stan, I don't know. I was trying to...",18:46
Leonard Feather,"Well does the sound correspond with the sound that you know, associate with Stan?",18:59
Ben Webster,"Yeah, yeah. No, but I mean you have your eyes up a little there.",19:03
Leonard Feather,I know.,19:07
Ben Webster,"Stan has a very round, beautiful sound. And he's a beautiful guy, I mean, you know. He plays some things that... I mean, you listen to a guy play, and you automatically try to anticipate where he's going. You understand he goes right there, you know? With a few embellishments.",19:10
Leonard Feather,"Being logical, right? He's logical.",19:50
Ben Webster,Yeah. Yeah.,19:51
Leonard Feather,Well you're very-,19:55
Ben Webster,"Maybe I'm wrong, maybe somebody else has come up with it, but I would say that's Stan Getz.",19:57
Leonard Feather,Okay.,20:00
